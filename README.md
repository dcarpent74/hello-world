# hello-world
I finally made something on GitHub...

It sure took long enough to get here.
Hopefully this is just the beginning of lots of fun!

Job searching, Meetups, Conferences, and such eats up lots of my time.
Beyond this I'm working on business development stuff, setting up a new server (hopefully with documentation and some video recording of the process), swimming more and getting in better shape, and contributing to a number of communities that have been making great contributions to my life.

The life of a multi-potentialite (see http://puttylike.com) can get very busy at times, but can also be very rewarding.

My multipod style is massively simultanious and I seldom get bored with a interest, they simply take a back seat to those with higher priorities.

My current stack of tech-learning objectives are as follows:

Golang - Looked at some code a little bit and attended a gRPC presentation, but I've yet to start trying to code.  I would like to use a couple of my tools (a tree-compare tools currently written in PERL/bash, and a hard link archive compression tool also written in PERL/bash) and port these to golang and add some long needed enhancements (which may also entail some redesign of the algorithms).

Kubernetes - Attended a number of presentations on Kubernetes recently.  I need to spend some time playing with the examples.  I'd like to get a hybrid private / public cloud setup working between my new home server when it is up and Google cloud.

IPv6 - It has been time to fully wrap my head around this now.  I'd really like to have caomparable proficiency with this as I have on IPv4.

OSB - Get something running to record or broadcast myself and my screens.  It is still early days for this idea, but looks like fun and maybe a good way to help other learn.

TW5 - I've been playing with TiddlyWiki5 for a while now, and have a few projects and wikis using TW5.  I'd like to plumb TW5 into a private container and modify it to be able to do git operations and publishing so I can have version controlled TW5 content and an easy way to push my wiki to GitHub pages or some other hosting location.
